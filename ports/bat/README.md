## Installation

   ```

2. Copy the `.tmTheme` files from this directory into bat's `themes` directory.
   - Alternatively, you can clone this repository and symlink the files.
3. Rebuild bat's cache:

   ```bash
   bat cache --build
   ```

4. Run `bat --list-themes` and check for BlueberryPeach:

   ```bash
   $ bat --list-themes | grep blueberry
   blueberry_peach_dark
   blueberry_peach_light

   ```

For each, decide whether you want to use `blueberry_peach_dark` or `blueberry_peach_light`.

   ```

   - Example: `BAT_THEME="blueberry_peach_dark"`.
